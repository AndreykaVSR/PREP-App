# PREP App. Project-3.

## Necessary Deliverables

A working app, built by the entire team.
A team Git repository hosted on Github, with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project.
A README.md file with:
An introduction of your app along with a screenshot (one is all you need to "introduce" your application).
Explanations of the technologies used (including outside APIs).
A link to your pitch-deck.
A link to your Trello board that contains your user stories, ERD, and wireframes.
A link to your deployed app on Heroku.
Documentation for your app's RESTful API endpoints.

## Technical Requirements

Working in a team requires more upfront planning to ensure the team is "on the same page"...

## Your team must:

Pitch your project to the class first thing Friday with a pitch deck that includes:

- The application name.
- Your team members and their roles.
- The problem you are going to solve with your app.
- Craft thoughtful User Stories together as a team and manage them in Trello.

## Manage team contributions and collaboration using Git, GitHub and a standard team work-flow.
